ldm - Lightweight Device Mounter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

I<ldm> [-d] [-r I<device>] [-g I<gid>] [-u I<uid>] [-p I<path>] [-c I<command>] [-h]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ldm is a lightweight device mounter following the UNIX philosophy written in C and based on udev and libmount.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-d> 

Run ldm as a daemon.

=item B<-r> I<device>

Ask the ldm daemon to unmount the selected device.

=item B<-g> I<gid>

Specify the gid of the user owning the mount points.

=item B<-u> I<uid>

Specify the uid of the user owning the mount points.

=item B<-p> I<path>

Specify the base folder for the mount points. The default is /mnt.

=item B<-c> I<command>

Specifies a command that is executed before and after a mount/unmount action. When the action is 'test' then ldm will block the current action if the script returns a non-zero value. The following environment variables are defined:

=over

=item B<LDM_MOUNTPOINT>

The complete path to the mountpoint.

=item B<LDM_NODE>

The path pointing to the device node in /dev

=item B<LDM_ACTION>

The action ldm has just performed, it can either be I<mount>, I<unmount> or I<test>

=item B<LDM_FILESYSTEM>

The filesystem on the device

=back

=item B<-h>

Print a brief help and exit.

=back

=head1 BLACKLISTING

ldm doesn't offer any blacklisting by itself but it honors the options found in the fstab so it will ignore any device with flag I<noauto>.

=head1 INSTALL

The included systemd service expects a config file at /etc/ldm.conf which contains your user uid and gid. Don't be scared, it's just a matter of writing down 3 lines using your favourite editor.
